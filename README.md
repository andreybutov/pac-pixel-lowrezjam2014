## Pac Pixel

*Pac Pixel* is my entry for [LowRez Jam 2014](http://jams.gamejolt.io/lowrezjam2014/games/pac-pixel/26312), a game competition where all game entries must be implemented in 32x32 pixels. The game is written in vanilla JavaScript. [Click here](http://andreybutov.github.io/pac-pixel-lowrezjam2014/) to play the game in the browser, or, download the repo and open **index.html** locally.
