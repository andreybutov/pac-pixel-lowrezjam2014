## Pac Pixel

*Pac Pixel* is my entry for [LowRez Jam 2014](http://jams.gamejolt.io/lowrezjam2014/games/pac-pixel/26312), a game competition where all game entries must be implemented in 32x32 pixels. The game is written in Javascript, and is [available to play online](http://www.andreybutov.com/lowrezjam2014/).
